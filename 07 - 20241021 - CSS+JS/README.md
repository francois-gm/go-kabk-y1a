## Intro (15min)

- A website you like (Duru, Yoonjin, François)

## Recap (15min)

- Questions related to layout (float vs flexbox, margin vs padding, etc).

## *Ode to CSS*, each present their final project (30min, 1min each)

### a) Put your website online

1) Create an account on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
2) `Site` -> `Deploy manually` (`browse to upload`).
3) When browsing, select your *project* folder (`my-project-template`, as an example), by this I mean the **root** folder of your project, that contains your `index.html`, your `assets` and your `content` folders.
4) There it is!

Add your url to the list.

### b) Presentation

- You have **two minutes** to present the website of one of your classmate (so not your website). See below for list.
  
- First, do a *test drive* of the website. *Click, resize, scroll*…
- **How does the website works?** Functionality? Aesthetics? Conceptual? **Describe it in a few sentences**.

Then:

- **Guess the CSS property** (class can help if not easy to guess, too).
- What does this project make you think of?
- Give a **positive quality** / something you **appreciate** in the website, and tell us **why**.
- Think of the challenges / difficulties of working with this CSS property? How was this addressed?
- If you would have to work on this website, are there elements you could either fine-tune or push further? Think functional, aesthetical, conceptual.

## Tutorial: Javascript essentials (30min)

- What does Javascript do?
  
- Essential terminology:
  - What is a variable?
  - What is an event (event handler)?
  - What is a function?
  - What is a conditional statement?
  - What are javascript expressions and operators?

## Tutorial: manipulating the document (the *DOM*) with Javascript (2h)

- We create basic JS event handlers (on click, on mouse over, on scroll)
- We create a toggler button (dark mode, and or a modal menu)
- We create a JS counter (increment)
- We create a randomizer (shows random sentences on click)
