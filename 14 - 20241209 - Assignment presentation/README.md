# Class 14, 2024/12/09

## Intro (15min)

- A website you like (Olya, Amy, Isaac, FranÃ§ois)

## *Poetic function*, each present their final project (2h)

### a) Put your website online (15min)

1) Create an account on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
2) `Site` -> `Deploy manually` (`browse to upload`).
3) When browsing, select your *project* folder (`my-project-template`, as an example), by this I mean the **root** folder of your project, that contains your `index.html`, your `assets` and your `content` folders.
4) There it is!

Add your url to the list.

### b) Presentation

1) Peer reviews

- You will have to collectively review every student's projects (!) For this we will use EtherPad, which allows to collaboratively (and anonymously) edit text in real time. 

For each project (except yours): write **one sentence** that summarizes the project. First take **one minute** to **navigate the project**, and **one minute** to **write** that sentence. The sentence shall have the form of an 'appraisal'. Please highlight positive points as well as bring a point of critique if that is relevant.

**What is critique?** *Not* equal to criticism. Critique more as the *faculty* of judging (a method of disciplined, systematic study).

Points you can include in your sentence:

- What it does?
- What works well?
- What could work better?
- What is the overall experience?

Use this [writing pad](https://pad.xpub.nl/p/Y1A_peer_reviews)

2) Presentation

Then you will present your website in front of the class. Besides that, you will pick three sentences and will read them out loud.
